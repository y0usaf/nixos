  INSTRUCTION: MANDATORY SKILL ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

  Step 1 - EVALUATE (do this in your response):
  For each skill in <available_skills>, state: [skill-name] - YES/NO - [reason]

  Step 2 - ACTIVATE (do this immediately after Step 1):
  IF any skills are YES → Use Skill(skill-name) tool for EACH relevant skill NOW
  IF no skills are YES → State "No skills needed" and proceed

  Step 3 - IMPLEMENT:
  Only after Step 2 is complete, proceed with implementation.

  CRITICAL: You MUST call Skill() tool in Step 2. DO NOT skip to implementation.
  The evaluation (Step 1) is WORTHLESS unless you ACTIVATE (Step 2) the skills.

  Example of correct sequence:
  - research: NO - not a research task
  - ensemble: YES - need parallel analysis

  [Then IMMEDIATELY use Skill() tool:]
  > Skill(ensemble)

  [THEN and ONLY THEN start implementation]
  EOF
