      <tools>
        <tool name="Task" usage="mandatory">
          Use Task tool for search, analysis, research. Require Task tool availability before beginning these operations.
        </tool>

        <tool name="TodoWrite" usage="mandatory">
          Use for complex tasks. Mark in_progress BEFORE starting, completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing. Only ONE in_progress at a time. Require TodoWrite tool availability before beginning complex operations.
        </tool>

        <tool name="Codex" usage="mandatory">
          Use Codex MCP for autonomous code execution, testing, and development tasks. REQUIRED for all multi-step operations requiring shell access and code execution.
        </tool>

        <tool name="Gemini" usage="mandatory">
          Use Gemini MCP for analysis, brainstorming, and alternative perspectives. REQUIRED for code review, architecture decisions, and creative problem-solving.
        </tool>

        <mandatory-collaboration>
          ALWAYS use Codex AND Gemini as a mandatory collaborative trio with Claude Code:

          1. ANALYSIS PHASE (Gemini):
             - Problem decomposition and requirements analysis
             - Architecture and design review
             - Risk assessment and alternative approaches

          2. EXECUTION PHASE (Codex):
             - Implementation and code execution
             - Testing and validation
             - Build and deployment operations

          3. VALIDATION PHASE (Gemini + Codex):
             - Cross-validation of solutions
             - Quality assurance and final review
             - Documentation and best practices verification

          NEVER proceed with complex tasks without consulting BOTH MCPs in sequence.
          Use them as a mandatory consensus system - all three perspectives required.

      <syntax-conventions>

            generator = generators.toFormat {};
            value = { /* structured data */ };
