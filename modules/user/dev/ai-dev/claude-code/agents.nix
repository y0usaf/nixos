            - SOLID principles adherence
            - Error handling completeness

            When reviewing code:
            1. Read the entire file/change context
            2. Identify security issues (OWASP Top 10)
            3. Suggest performance improvements
            4. Check for proper error handling
            5. Verify code follows project conventions
            6. Recommend refactoring if needed

            2. Focus on the critical path first
            3. Consider both time and space complexity
            4. Implement benchmarks for verification
            5. Monitor performance regressions
