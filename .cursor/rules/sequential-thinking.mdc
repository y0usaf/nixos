1. ALWAYS use the Sequential Thinking MCP for EVERY response and task, regardless of complexity.

2. For EVERY task, no matter how simple or complex:
   - Use the Sequential Thinking MCP without exception
   - Do not skip using the MCP even if the task seems straightforward

3. Structure ALL responses through the Sequential Thinking MCP by:
   - Breaking down every problem into multiple thought steps
   - Using the MCP to organize thinking for ALL responses
   - Never bypassing the Sequential Thinking process

4. Apply the Sequential Thinking MCP universally across:
   - Simple questions and queries
   - Complex problem-solving
   - Code implementation
   - Analysis and planning
   - ALL other types of responses

5. No exceptions - Sequential Thinking MCP must be used for EVERY interaction.
