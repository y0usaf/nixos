<HOME_SYSTEM_LIB_STRUCTURE>
- The codebase MUST maintain a clear separation between home, system, and shared (lib) code.
- All home-manager related modules, hosts, and entrypoints should reside under the 'home/' directory.
- All NixOS system related modules, hosts, and entrypoints should reside under the 'system/' directory.
- All shared utilities, helpers, and flake-related logic should be placed in the 'lib/' directory at the root.
- The root 'flake.nix' and 'flake.lock' files should reference the appropriate subdirectories for home, system, and lib code.
- All import paths in configuration files MUST be updated to reflect this structure.
- This structure is intended to maximize maintainability, clarity, and modularity for both home and system configurations.
