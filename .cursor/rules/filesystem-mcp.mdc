<FILESYSTEM_MCP>
- The Filesystem MCP MUST be used for ALL file and directory operations, without exception.
- This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Browsing directories
  - Reading files
  - Writing files
  - Moving, renaming, or deleting files or directories
  - Understanding code context
  - Ensuring complete understanding of the codebase structure
- NO alternative tools, methods, or direct code inference are permitted for file operations.
- Never attempt to infer file contents or structure without using the Filesystem MCP tools.
- Filesystem exploration using the MCP MUST be performed before making any changes to code.
- The starting directory for all operations is ~/nixos, so all file and directory paths should be referenced as ~/nixos/{file} or ~/nixos/{directory}.
- Any violation of this rule is strictly prohibited.
- This rule is intended to maximize accuracy, reproducibility, and maintainability in all file and directory operations.
