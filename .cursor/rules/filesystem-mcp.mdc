<FILESYSTEM_MCP>
- ALWAYS use the Filesystem MCP when working with files or directories
- For any file operations, use the appropriate file-related MCPs to:
  - Browse directories
  - Read files
  - Understand code context
  - Ensure complete understanding of the codebase structure
- Never attempt to infer file contents without using filesystem tools
- Apply filesystem exploration before making changes to code
